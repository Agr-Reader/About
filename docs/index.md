## 常见问题
::: details What is RSS?
RSS, short for Really Simple Syndication, is a format used for subscribing to and distributing website content. Through RSS, websites can provide structured information such as article titles, summaries, and full texts. Users can subscribe to a website’s RSS link and view updates from multiple sites in one RSS reader.

In short, RSS allows users to see the latest content from multiple sources in one place without visiting each site individually. This approach provides higher efficiency and greater autonomy in content consumption, avoiding the randomness and overload of algorithm-driven recommendations.

::: details Why Choose RSS?
In the age of information overload, social media and content aggregation tools use algorithms to recommend a large amount of content that may interest us but can also lead to information overload and narrow the types of information we encounter.

RSS (Really Simple Syndication) offers a solution. It allows us to independently choose and subscribe to information sources without algorithm interference, displaying content in chronological order. This way, we can effectively control the information we receive, avoiding information overload.

Although RSS has a higher learning curve, its reliability—like a diligent student who completes tasks on time—allows us to efficiently obtain the information we need, making it an ideal tool for managing modern information excess.
