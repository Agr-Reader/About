### Article Content Source
If there are display issues with the article content, you can try switching the source:
- Content Summary: Displays the article summary provided by the feed source. Use this option when full-text parsing is not ideal.
- Full-text Parsing: The default option where AgrReader parses the original article content. Note that this may not work perfectly for some feeds.
- Embedded Webpage: Loads the article page directly in an embedded browser format.

### Push Notifications
When the "Enable Push Notifications" option is turned on, you will receive notifications when there are updates to the feed. For background notification capabilities, ensure that background activity and battery policies are unrestricted. Power consumption depends on the sync frequency set, but it's usually minimal.

### Block Web Resource Loading
If images or other content fail to load on some web pages, try enabling this option.

## Translation Settings
When enabled, immersive translation will be automatically applied when opening articles from this feed. If not enabled, translation needs to be triggered manually by clicking the translation button.
