## Finding Your Favorite RSS Feeds
First, we need to find the RSS feed you want to subscribe to.

Here are some recommended websites to help you find useful RSS feeds:

Once you find the RSS feed you want to subscribe to, it’s usually a URL. For example, let’s take BBC News as an example:
http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml

You can open this URL directly to see an XML-formatted page. This is a basic RSS feed. Similarly, you can use this method to verify the validity of an RSS feed.
